\section*{Abstract} {\bf 
      The recently observed population of 540 free-floating
      jupiter-mass objects, and 42 dynamically soft pairs of
      jupiter-mass planets, among which 2 with a tertiary companion,
      in the Trapezium cluster has raised interesting questions on
      their formation and further evolution.  We test various
      scenarios for the origin and survivability of these free
      floating jupiter-mass planets and Jupiter-mass Binary Objects
      (JuMBOs) in the Trapezium cluster.  The numerical calculations
      are performed by direct N-body integration of the stars and
      planets in the Trapezium cluster starting with a wide variety of
      planets in various configurations. We discuss four main models:
      $\mathcal{SPP}$ in which selected stars have two outer orbiting
      jupiter-mass planets; $\mathcal{SPM}$ where selected stars are
      orbited by jupiter-mass planet-moon pairs; $\mathcal{ISF}$ in
      which \jumbos\, form in situ together with the stars, and
      $\mathcal{FFC}$ where we introduce a population of free floating
      single jupiter-mass objects, but no binaries.  Models
      $\mathcal{SPP}$ and $\mathcal{FFC}$ spectacularly fail to
      produce enough \jumbos. Models $\mathcal{SPM}$ can produce
      sufficient free floaters and \jumbos\, but require to start with
      unrealistically wide orbits for the planet-moon system around
      the star. The observed
      populations of \jumbos\, and free floating planets in the
      Trapezium cluster are best reproduced if they formed in pairs
      and as free floaters together with the other stars in a smooth
      (Plummer) density profile with a virial radius of $\sim
      0.5$\,pc.  A fractal (with fractal dimension 1.6) stellar
      density distribution works also, but requires a very high
      initial binary fraction (close to unity) among free floating
      planet-mass objects.  This would make the primordial binary
      fraction of jumbos\, even higher than the already high observed
      fraction of $\sim 8$\,\% (42/540). The fraction of \jumbos\,
      will continue to drop with time, and the lack of jumbos\, in
      Upper Scorpius could then result of its higher age, causing more
      \jumbos\, to be ionized. We then also predict that the
      interstellar density of jupiter-mass objects (either single or
      some lucky surviving binaries) is $\sim 0.05$\,\jumbos\, per
      pc$^{-3}$ (or around 0.24 per star).  }

\section{Introduction}

Recently \cite{2023arXiv231001231P} reported on the discovery of 42
Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (\jumbos) in the direction of the
Trapezium cluster.  Their component masses range between 0.6\,\MJup\,
and 14\,\MJup\, and have projected separations between 25\,au and
380\,au.  Two of these objects have a nearby tertiary jupiter-mass
companion.  They also observed a population of 540 single objects in
the same mass range. This discovery initiates the discussions on the
origin and surviveability of weakly bound jupiter-mass pairs in a
clustered environment.

The first single free-floating jupiter-mass objects have been found in
the direction of the Trapzium cluster more than 20 years ago
\cite{2000Sci...290..103Z,2000MNRAS.314..858L,2000AGM....17..A11M}.
Many more have been found since then, for example in the young
clustered environment of Upper Scorpius \cite{2022NatAs...6...89M}, and
through gravitational microlensing surveys in the direction of the
Galactic bulge \cite{2011Natur.473..349S}.  Their abundance may be as
high as $1.9^{+1.3}_{-0.8}$ per star \cite{2011Natur.473..349S},
although a considerable fraction of these could be in wide orbits, or
have masses $\ll M_{\rm Jupiter}$.


The origin of these free floating planets has been actively debated
\cite{2023Ap&SS.368...17M}. Star formation, from the collapse of a
molecular cloud through gravitational instability, generally is
expected to lead to objects considerably more massive than Jupiter
\cite{1976MNRAS.176..367L,2005A&A...430.1059B}, and in disks planets
tend to form with lower masses. As a consequence, the large population
of jupiter-mass free-floaters is often considered to result from fully
packed planetary systems \cite{2023arXiv231015603C}, or kicked out of
their orbit by encounters with other stars in the young cluster
\cite{2019A&A...624A.120V}. Single jupiter-mass free floating objects
then originally formed in a disk around a star but became single later
in time
\cite{1996Sci...274..954R,2015MNRAS.453.2759Z,2002ApJ...565.1251H,2017MNRAS.470.4337C,
  2019MNRAS.489.2280F,2019A&A...624A.120V}.  The number of
super-jupiter mass free floating planets formed in this way is
expected to be on the order of one ($\sim 0.71$) per star
\cite{2019A&A...624A.120V}, but lower-mass free floaters orphaned this
way may be much more abundant \cite{2002ApJ...565.1251H}; The origin
of relatively massive free-floaters through dynamical phenomena is
further complicated by the tendency for lower mass planets to be more
prone to ejections
\cite{2001Icar..150..303F,2013MNRAS.433..867H,2019MNRAS.489.2280F,2020MNRAS.497.1807S}.

Explaining the observed abundance and mass-function of single
free-floating jupiter-mass objects is difficult.  In particular the
large population of objects in Upper Scorpius challenges the formation
channels. The new discovery of a large population of paired
free-floaters complicates matters even further, and puts strong
constraints about their origin. So far, binary free-floaing
planet-mass object have been rare, and were only discovered in tight
(few au) orbits \cite{2021ApJS..253....7K}.  Known interstellar
jupiter-mass binary objects include only four objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$]2MASS J11193254-1137466 AB: a $5$ to 10\,\MJup\,
  primary in a $a=3.6\pm0.9$\,au orbit \cite{2017ApJ...843L...4B}.
\item[$\bullet$]WISE 1828+2650: a 3 to 6\MJup\, primary with a
  5\,\MJup\ companion in an $\apgt 0.5$\,au orbit
  \cite{2013ApJ...764..101B}.
\item[$\bullet$] WISE J0336-014: a $8.5$ to
  $18$\,\MJup\ primary with a $5$ to $11.5$\,\MJup\, companion in a
  $0.9^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$\,au orbit \cite{2023ApJ...947L..30C}.
\item[$\bullet$]2MASS J0013-1143 discovered by \cite{2017AJ....154..112K} and
  suspected to be a binary by \cite{2019A&A...629A.145E}.
\end{itemize}

Such tight pairs could have formed as binary planets (or planet-moon
pairs) orbiting a stars, to be dislodged from their parents to become
\jumbos\, \cite{2016ApJ...819..125C}.  So long only a few were
discovered such an exotic scenario seems to pose a reasonable
explanation for their existence, but the discovery of a rich
population of $42$ wide \jumbos\, \cite{2023arXiv231001231P} requires
a more thorough study on their origin.

Adopting a dynamical origin, or at least a dynamical history, we
perform direct N-body simulations of a Trapezium-like star cluster
with primordial Jupiter-mass objects (JMO) and \jumbos. Our
simulations focus on four models that could explain the abundance,
their masses, and the orbital characteristics (actually the observed
separation distribution) of the observed jupiter-mass objects in the
cluster. In this paper, we perform a rudimentary analysis on four
scenarios capable of forming \jumbos.  Alternative to forming in situ
(scenario ${\cal ISF}$), one can naively imagine three mechanisms to
form \jumbos. \cite{2023arXiv231006016W} argued that these binaries
could be explained from hierarchical planetary systems of which the
outer two planets are stripped by a passing star in a close
encounter. The two ejected planets would lead to a population of free
floating planets, but could also explain the observed population of
\jumbos.  We call this scenario ${\cal SPP}$ (for star planet-planet).

Alternatively one could imagine \jumbos\, to result from planet-moon
pairs (or binary planets) orbiting some star that is ejected to become
a \jumbo.  We call this scenario ${\cal SPM}$, for star planet-moon.
Finally, one could imagine that a sufficiently large population of
free-floating jupiter-mass objects could lead to a population of
\jumbos\,by dynamical capture of one JMO by another.  We call this
scenario ${\cal FFC}$ (free floating capture). A similar scenario was
proposed by \cite{2010MNRAS.404.1835K} for explaining very wide
stellar pairs, but the model was also adopted to account for wide
planetary orbits \cite{2012ApJ...750...83P,2018MNRAS.473.1589G}

We start by discussing some fundamental properties of the
environmental dynamics, followed by a description of models, the
numerical simulations to characterize the parameters of the acquired
\jumbos, and the resulting occurrence rates.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The dynamical characterization of \jumbos}

The \jumbos\, discovered by \cite{2023arXiv231001231P} were located in
the Trapezium cluster. We base our analysis on the parameters derived
for this cluster by \cite{2016MNRAS.457..313P} by numerical modeling
of disk-size distributions observed in the Trapezium cluster, and
concluded that this distribution is best reproduced for a cluster
containing $\sim 2500$ stars with a total mass of $\sim 900$\,\MSun\,
and a half-mass radius of $\sim 0.5$\,pc. The results were
inconsistent with a Plummer \cite{1911MNRAS..71..460P} distribution,
but match the observations if the initial cluster density distribution
represented a fractal dimension of 1.6.  Nevertheless, for consistency
with earlier studies, we perform our analysis for Plummer as well as
for a fractal distributions (with fractal dimension 1.6).

Adopting a Plummer distribution of the Trapezium cluster (with virial
radius $r_{\rm vir} = 0.5$\,pc), the cluster core radius $r_c \simeq
0.64r_{\rm vir} \sim 0.32$\,pc with a core mass of 250\,\MSun,
resulting in a velocity dispersion of $v_{\rm disp} \equiv
GM/\sqrt{r_c^2 + r_{\rm vir}^2} \simeq 0.97$\,km/s. With a mean
stellar mass in the cluster core of 1\,\MSun\, the unit of energy
expressed in the kinematic temperature kT becomes $\sim 8 \cdot
10^{42}$\,erg.

Jumbos are found in the mass range of about 0.6\,\MJup\, to
14\,\MJup\, and have a projected separation of 25\,au\, and $\sim
380$\,au.  The averaged observed values are $d=200\pm109$\,au,
$\langle M\rangle = 4.73\pm3.48$\,\MJup, and $\langle m\rangle =
2.81\pm2.29$\,\MJup. The median and 25\,\% to 75\,\% percentiles are
$d = 193.8^{+78.2}_{-114.1}$\,au $M = 3.67^{+1.31}_{-1.57}$\,\MJup,
and $m = 2.10^{+1.05}_{-1.05}$\,\MJup.

To simplify our analysis, let us assume that the observed variation in
projected distances between the two Jupiter-mass objects corresponds
to an orbital separation, and express distances in terms of semi-major
axis (see Appendix\,\ref{Appendix:A} for motivation).  In practice,
the differences between the projected separation and the actual
semi-major axis of the orbit is small. Adopting a statistical
approach, a thermal distribution in eccentricities and a random
projection on the sky, the semi-major axis is statitically $\sim 1.2$
times the projected separation.  For the observed \jumbos\, we do not
really know if they are bound, and if so, we do not know the
underlying eccentricity distribution, but in practice this difference
between projected separation and actual semi-major axis of a bound
population is negligible compared to the 25\% to 75\% uncertainty
intervals derived from the simulations.

To first order, the binding energy of jumbos then ranges between $\sim
5\cdot 10^{37}$\,erg and $1.4\cdot 10^{41}$\,erg, or at most $\sim
0.02$\,kT. This makes them soft upon an encounter with a cluster star.
The hardest \jumbo, composed of two 14\,\MJup\, planets in a 25\,au
orbit would be hard for another encountering object of less then
$17\,M_{\rm Jupiter}$.  For an encountering 1\,\MJup\, object a 25\,au
orbit would be hard only if the two planets are about three times as
massive a Jupiter.  This entails that \jumbos\, are generally soft for
any encountering free floating giant planet unless they are in tight
enough orbits or the perturber is of low mass.  On average, soft
encounters tend to soften these binaries even further
\cite{1975MNRAS.173..729H}, although an occasional soft encounter with
another planet may actually slightly harden the \jumbo.  Independent
of how tight the orbit, \jumbos\, are expected to be relatively short
lived, because they easily dissociate upon a close encounter with any
other cluster member.  Once ionized they contribute to the population
of free floating single objects.  Note that in the Trapezium cluster,
even the orbits of 2MASS J11193254-1137466AB, and WISE 1828+2650 would
be soft ($\apgt 0.025$\,kT); they could be the hardest
survivors of an underlying population.

To further understand the dynamics of \jumbos\, in a clustered
environment, and to study the efficiency of the various formation
scenarios we perform direct $N$-body calculations of the Trapezium
star cluster with a population of jupiter-mass objects in various
initial configurations.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Model calculations}

For each of our proposed models, ${\cal ISF}$ (in situ formation of
jumbos), ${\cal SPP}$ (\jumbos\, formed via ejections of a host stars
outer planets), ${\cal SPM}$ (as planet-moon pairs orbiting a star),
and ${\cal FFC}$ (as mutual capture of free-floaters) we perform a
series of $N$-body simulations with properties consistent with the
Trapezium cluster.

Each cluster starts with 2500 single stars taken from a broken
power-law mass-function \cite{2002Sci...295...82K} between
$0.08$\,\MSun\, and $30$\,\MSun\, distributed either in a Plummer
sphere (model Pl) or a fractal distribution with a fractal dimension
of 1.6 (model Fr). All models start in virial equilibrium.  We run
three models for each set of initial conditions, with a virial radius
of 0.25\,pc, 0.5\,pc and 1.0\,pc, called model R025, R05 and R100,
respectively.  We further assume stellar radii to follow the zero-age
main sequence, and the radius of jupiter-mass objects based on a
density consistent with Jupiter ($\sim 1.33$\,g/cc).

For each of our proposed models, we initialize a population of single
JMOs and/or \jumbos\, (binary JMOs). The single (and primaries in
planet pairs) are selected from a power-law mass function between
0.8\,\MJup\, and 14\,\MJup, which is consistent with the observed mass
function \cite{2023arXiv231001231P}. We fitted a power-law to the
primary-planet mass function, which has a slope of $\alpha_{\jumbo}
=-1.2$ (considearbly flatter than Salpter's $\alpha_{\rm Salpter} =
-2.35$).

This relatively flat mass function is not inconsistent with the mass
distribution of earlier observed free floaters The first dozen
discovered free floaters already seemd to have a rather flat mass
function \cite{2000MNRAS.314..858L}, but the large statistics
available through gravitational microlensing surveys allowd a reliable
estimate of the slope, which yields $\alpha = -1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$
\cite{2011Natur.473..349S}. This mass function is somewhat steeper
than the slope derived for lower-mass free floaters ($\alpha =
-0.96^{+0.47}_{-0.27}$ \cite{2023AJ....166..108S}).

For each of the four models, we have a special set of initial
configurations. The clusters all have the same statistical
representation, being either Plummer or fractal density distributions,
virialized and with a virial radius of 0.25 ,pc, 0.5\,pc and
1.0\,pc. But the distribution of JMOs and \jumbos\, varies per model.
In figure\,\ref{Fig:models} we scetsch the various models.

\subsection{Model ${\cal SPP}$: Star hierarchically orbited by two planets}

For scenario ${\cal SPP}$, we selected the star to host a
planetary system from the 150 stars lower in mass than 0.6\,\MSun\,
and 150 more massive stars. The mid-mass point (of 0.6\,\MSun) is
almost twice the mean stellar mass in the mass function.

We select the planet masses as for the primordial \jumbos\, except
that we have them orbiting one of the selected stars as a hierarchical
planetary system. The distance from the first planet $a_1$ and the
second planet $a_2$ (such that $a_2>a_1$) are selected according to
various criteria.  The inner orbit $a_1$ was selected randomly between
25\,au and $400$\,au from a flat distribution in $a$.  The outer
orbit, $a_2$, we typically chose to be five times larger than the
inner planet's Hill radius.  This guarantees that the planetary
systems would be rather stable when in isolation, but rather
vulnerable for external perturbations.

Both planetary orbits are rather circular with a random eccentricity
from the thermal distribution between circular and $0.02$.  The mass
of the secondary planet (could be either the inner one or the outer
one) was selected randomly from a thermal distribution between a mass
ratio of 0.2 and unity. As a consequence, we have a slight preference
for planets of comparable mass, and we do have a population of $\aplt
0.8$\,\MJup\, objects, which are not observed.  This low-mass
population contributes to $\sim 7.3$\,\% of the total.

The two planets orbit the star in a plane with a relative inclination
randomly between $-1^\circ$ and $1^\circ$. The other orbital elements
are randomly taken from their isotripic distributions.  We perform an
additional series of simulations with pre-specified orbital
separations for the two planets $a_1$ and $a_2$, to follow the model
proposed in \cite{2023arXiv231006016W}. The results of these runs are
presented in figure\,\ref{Fig:fjumbos_from_PP}.

\subsection{Model ${\cal SPM}$: Star orbited by a pair of planet-mass objects}

In the ${\cal SPM}$ models we initialize planet pairs (or planet with
moons) in orbit around a star. The masses of the stars, planets and
moons are selected as in the ${\cal SPP}$ model.  The planet-moon
system orbit was selected from a flat distribution in $a$ between
$25$\,au and $200$\,au, and with a eccentricity from the thermal
distribution with a maximum of $0.02$.

To warrant stability of the star-planet-moon system, we chose an
orbital separation such that the planet-moon pair stays witin 1/3th of
it's Hill radius in orbit around the star, again with an eccentricity
smaller than $0.02$ taken randomly from the thermal distribution.  The
planet-moon system is randomly orientation.  These sustems tend to be
dynamically stable, but some fraction is subject to von
Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles
\cite{1910AN....183..345V,1962PSS..9..719L,1962AJ.....67..591K}.  With
the adopted range of masses and orbital parameters the time-scale for
a cycle is of the order of a few tens to a few hundreds of years.  Two
jupiter-mass objects in a circular 100\,au orbit around a 1\,\MSun\,
star would lead to a circum-stellar orbit of about 3488\,au, the von
Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai period of such a system is less then 600 years.


\subsection{Model ${\cal ISF}$: Jupiter-mass objects in weakly bound orbits}

Primordial \jumbos\, (model ${\cal ISF}$) are initialized with
semi-major axis with a flat distribution between 25\,au and
$1000$\,au, an eccentricity from the thermal distribution between 0
and 1, but they are to remain separated at pericenter.  The masses are
selected as in model ${\cal SPP}$.  Each system is subsequenlty
rotated to a random orientation.  The binaries are sprinkled in the
cluster potential as single objects using the same initial
distribution function as used for the stars.

\subsection{Model ${\cal FFC}$: Jupiter-mass objects as free-floating among the stars}\label{Sect:FFC}

For the models with free-floating jupiter-mass objects, model ${\cal
  FFC}$, we sprinkle the single planets from the primary-mass function
(see model ${\cal SPP}$) in the cluster potential as single objects
using the same initial distribution function as we used for the single
stars.  These models were run with 600\,jupiter-mass objects (rather
than 300 pairs in the other models).

We performed additional runs with $10^4$ free floaters. Some of these
runs have a different lower-limit to the mass function, but we keep
the number of objects with a mass $>0.8$\,\MJup\, at 600 (assuming
that objects of lower-mass objects are unobservable).  Each simulation
is evolved for 1\,Myr, after which we study the population of free
floating jupiter-mass objects and the population of \jumbos. A few
simulations were extended to 10\,Myr, to study the long term
surviveability of \jumbos.

In figure\,\ref{Fig:models} we illustrate the four models with a
schematic diagram.

\subsection{The simulations}

All calculations are performed using 4-th order prediction-correction
direct $N$-body integrator {\sc ph4} \cite{2022A&A...659A..86P}
through the Astrophysical MUltipurpose Software Environment, or AMUSE
for short
\cite{2013CoPhC.183..456P,2013AA...557A..84P,2018araa.book.....P}.
The data files are stored in {\sc AMUSE} formatted particle sets, and
available via zenodo \url{10.5281/zenodo.10149241}, and the source
code is available at github \url{https://github.com/spzwart/JuMBOs}.

The script to run the simulations is fairly simple.  It is essentially
the same script from chapter 2 in \cite{2018araa.book.....P},
including the collision-detection stopping condition.  Runs are
performed with the default time-step parameter $\eta=0.03$, which
typically leads to a relative energy error $<10^{-8}$ per step, and
$\aplt 10^{-5}$ at the end of the run. The fractal initial conditions with
small virial radius (0.25\,pc) are, not surprisingly, the hardest runs
to perform. The energy error in these runs can be somewhat higher at
times, but never exceed $<10^{-3}$, which according to
\cite{2041-8205-785-1-L3}, suffices for a statistically reliable
result.

Snapshots were stored every 0.1\,Myr, and the simulations were
continued until 1.1\,Myr. The data analysis is performed on the
snapshots of the 1\,Myr old cluster.

Although incorporating stellar evolution, general relativity and the
Galactic tidal field would have been straightforward, we decided to
ignore those.  We do not expect any stars to effectively lose much
mass during the short duration of the simulations, or the tidal field
to have any influence on the close encounters.  Incorporating general
relativity would have made the calculations expensive without much
astrophysical gain.

\subsection{Finding \jumbos}

\jumbos\, are soft in terms of the average local kinetic energy of the
surrounding objects (stars and planets), and this makes them somewhat
hard to find in the numerical models.  One generally consider hard
binary paris or multiples in direct N-body simulations and finding
those soft pairs requires some extra effort.  We search for \jumbos\,
by first selecting any object in the cluster, star or planet, and find
the bound neares neighbors. If one of these companions has another
object as nearests neighbor, we adopt that as the close pair, and the
initially selected object as the tertiary. Later, we order the
particles in terms of distance and mass, on which the eventual
designation is based. We recognice single stars $s$, and planets $p$
(although we are uncertain weather or not to call these objects
planets). Pairs of objects are then placed in parenthesis, for binary
stars we write $(s,s)$, a planetary system can be $(s,p)$ (single
planet) or $((s,p),p)$ (planet pair as in the ${\cal SPP}$ model) or
$(s,(p,p))$ (planet pair orbiting a star as in the ${\cal SPM}$
model). \jumbos\, in this terminology are indicated as $(p,p)$.

\section{Results}

The main results of the calculations are presented in the tables
table\,\ref{Tab:model_numbers} and
table\,\ref{Tab:orbital_distributions}.

In table\,\ref{Tab:model_numbers} we list per model the different
model outcomes.  The various simulation results are named after their
model designation followed by either the letter ``Pl'' for the Plummer

The ${\cal SPP}$ and ${\cal FFC}$ models systematically fail to
reproduce the observed population of \jumbos\, by a factor of 50 to
400. Changing the initial distribution in semi-major axis of the inner
orbit from a uniform distribution to a logarithmic distribution
reduces the formation rate of \jumbos\, even further.  There are
several systematic trends in terms of cluster density and Plummer
versus fractal distribution, but it is not clear how these models can
lead to \jumbos. Both models produce a considearble population of
binary stars and single planetary systems, in particular in the
fractal distributions, where the typical fraction of dynamically
formed binary stars is around 4\,\%, and the fraction of plantary
sytems 0.7\,\% per star.  Interestingly, the model that already start
with some paired configuration with a star tends to produce more
binaries and planetary systems, that the models where planet-mass
objects do not orbit stars.  The high abunance of hierarchical
multiple planets, $((s,p),p)$, in the ${\cal SPP}$\_Pl and ${\cal
  SPM}$\_Pl models reflects some of the initial conditions. These
models also end to produce a relatively rich population of single
planet systems $(s,p)$.

The only models that produce a considerably population of \jumbos\,
are the ${\cal SPM}$ models and the ${\cal ISF}$. Where for the latter
the Plummer distributions tend to produce sufficient number of
\jumbos\, whereas the fractal model produce too few.  To further
mediate the discussion, we calculate orbital parameters for the
surviving \jumbos\, in the various models.

The median, the 25\% and 75\% quartiles for the \jumbo, $(p,p)$,
distribution for primary mass, secondary mass, semi-major axis and
eccentricity are presented in table\,\ref{Tab:orbital_distributions}.
The models that produce too few \jumbos\, to calculate the median and
quartiles are omitted.

The primary masses produced in our models ${\cal SPM}$ and ${\cal
  ISF}$, tend to be on the high side, but the secondary masses are in
the observed range.  The ${\cal SPM}$ models all tend to lead to
orbits that are too tight. Leaving out the $a<25$\,au \jumbos\, does
not improve the median orbital separation.

In terms of the orbital separation (or projected distance) the best
model seems to be the ${\cal ISF}$ Plummer model with a 0.5\,pc virial
radius, but the distributions are wide, and the 1\,pc ${\cal ISF}$
fractal model exhibits a low formation rate, but the appropriate
separation distribution.  We tend to prefer the former, though,
because it reproduces the observed large number of \jumbos, the binary
fraction compared to the number of JMOs, and it reproduces the
observed range in projected separation.

The eccentricity distribution in the ${\cal SPM}$ Plummer models is
systematically smaller than in the fractal models.  In these
models, the planet-moon pairs started in almost circular orbits,
whereas in the ${\cal SPM}$ they started with higher average
eccentricities.  In the fractal models, the eccentricities are more
effectively perturbed and thermalized, whereas in the plummer models
this did seem to have happened.

\subsection{Fine-tuning for the binary fraction and separation distribution}

        \caption{Fraction of jumbos as a function of time for models
          ${\cal ISF}$\_Fr\_R050 and ${\cal ISF}$\_Fr\_R100 (with a
          fractal initial density profile). The former model we also
          calculate with an aditional population of single
          jupiter-mass objects. The number of free floating objects is
          the same as the number if primordial \jumbos\, and their
          masses are taken from the primary mass function.}
        \label{Fig:Fjumbo_vs_time_model_ISF_Fr}
\end{figure}

In figure\,\ref{Fig:Fjumbo_vs_time_model_ISF_Fr} we illustrate how the
fraction of jumbos\, rapidly decreases with time in models ${\cal
  ISF}$\_Fr\_R050 and ${\cal ISF}$\_Fr\_R100 for the light blue and
red curves.  The binary fraction among jupite-mass objects
initially drops exponentially, to slow down after about 0.1\,Myr at a
survival fraction of $\sim 2$\,\% for the 0.5\,pc virial radius and
$\sim 10$\,\% for the 1\,pc virial radius cluster. For the latter
model, the fraction of \jumbos\, drops eventually to about 4\,\%. Both
fractions are lower than the observed 8\,\%.

          which all \jumbos\, were initially in circular orbits (light
          blue), and the model in which we constain the initial
          separation to 400\,au\, rather than the generally adopted
          1000\,au. }
        \label{Fig:sma_vs_time_model_ISF_Fr}
   \end{figure}

To investigate the evolution of the mean orbital separation of the
surviving \jumbos, and the effect of chaning the initial distribution
in orbital separation, we present
figure\,\ref{Fig:sma_vs_time_model_ISF_Fr}. Here we show how the
distribution in orbital separation of the jumbos\, in model ${\cal
  ISF}$\_Pl\_R050 rapidly drops with time, and quickly converges to a
median separation $<100$\,au. This distribution is much narroware and
on average with a smaller mean than observed in the Trapezium
cluster.

We further explore the effect of changing the initial eccentricity or
semi-major axis distribution, but these choices do not seem to make a
sufficienly big difference as to salvage the fractal models for
explaining the observed population of \jumbos.  Starting with a
tighter population of \jumbos\, will help delaying the ionization of
the \jumbos, but hardly affects the eventual distribution in orbital
separation.

We perform an extra series of simulations in which we initialize a
population of single free floating jupiter-mass objects (dark
blue). The masses of these free floater is identical to that of the
\jumbo\, primaries, and they are distriuted in the same profile.  For
model ${\cal ISF}$\_Fr\_R050, illustrated in
figure\,\ref{Fig:Fjumbo_vs_time_model_ISF_Fr} this additional
population does not seem to make a big difference is the binary
survival rate.

In figure\,\ref{Fig:Fjumbo_vs_time_model_ISF_Pl}, we show the binary
fraction among jupiter-mass objects for the same Plummer models ${\cal
  ISF}$\_Pl\_R050 (light blue) and ${\cal ISF}$\_Pl\_R100 (red).  The
fraction of \jumbos\, in these models drops slower than for the
fractal models, presented in
figure\,\ref{Fig:Fjumbo_vs_time_model_ISF_Fr}.

        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/Plummer_General_fJuMBO_evol.pdf}

          ${\cal ISF}$\_Pl\_R050 and ${\cal ISF}$\_Pl\_R100 (with a

            ISF}$\_Pl\_R050 we also perform a calculation with a
          population of single jupiter-mass objects. The number of
          free floating objects is the same as the number if
          primordial \jumbos\, and their masses are taken from the
          primary mass function.}
        \label{Fig:Fjumbo_vs_time_model_ISF_Pl}
\end{figure}

Adding a population of free floaters to the Plummer models, makes
considerable difference in the evolution of the \jumbo\, fraction in
the Plummer model, but eventually, after about 1\,Myr their fraction
converges to roughly the same value.

\subsection{Stellar and planetary collisions}

We encountered quite a number of collisions in the simulation, but the
vast majority occur between two stars (83\%), or a star and a
jupiter-mass object (17\%).  Collisions between two Jupiter-mass
objects are very rare.  Most collisions happen in the fractal models.
In figure\,\ref{Fig:collision_evolution_ISF_Fr} we present the
cumulative distribution of collisions in the models {\cal ISF}\_Fr
with a virial radius of 0.25\,pc (solid blue), 0.5\,pc (orange) and
1.0\,pc (green), and for the equivalent models {\cal FFC}\_Pl with the
thin hash-dotted curves.  The higher density naturally leads to more
collisions, and those collisions tend to occur earlier in time.  It
came as a but of a surprise, though, that the Plummer models with free
floating objects lead to so many collisions, even though the
collisions did not happen between two jupiter-mass objects.

Plummer models tend to lead to fewer collisions.  The only Plummer
models in which collisions among stars were common is in model ${\cal
  FFC}$ with 64, 20 and 18 collisions on average per cluster, for
those models with a viral radius of 0.25\,pc, 0.5\,pc and 1.0\,pc,
respectively.  Interestingly enough, the fractal models from the same
series only experience 30, 17 and 14 collisions for the same virial
radii.

\subsection{Runaway \jumbos}

In addition to mergers, ejection events also occured. Though no
\jumbos\, were ejected, $\sim1$ JMO was ejected per simulation and
$\sim 3$ stellar-mass objects.

\section{Discussion}

We explore the possible origin of the rich population of jupiter-mass
binary objects (\jumbos) in the direction of the Trapezium cluster.
The main problems in explaining the observations hides in the large
number of jupiter-mass objects, their large binary fraction and the
wide separations. Assuming that they are bound, their orbits
would be soft for any encounter in the cluster, and they are not
expected to survive for more than a few kyr.

The ease at which \jumbos\, are ionized is illustrated in
figure\,\ref{Fig:sma_vs_time_model_ISF_Fr}. It may be clear that the
fractal models, due to their high frequency of strong encounters an
the earliest cluster lifetime have difficulty preserving wide (soft)
planet-mass pairs. Plummer models are less dynamically interactive,
and the fraction of \jumbos\, remains much higher, and even relatively
wide pairs can survive.

An alternative explanation for the large population of pairs among the
free-floating jupiter-mass objects might be that they form late.  If
\jumbos\, only formed in the last $\sim 0.3$\,Myr They had a better
chance to survive in the harsh cluster dynamical environment.  Such a
later formation would hardly affect the estimated mass of the objects,
because the cooling curves, used to estimate their mass from the
observed temperature and luminosity is rather flat at such young age
\cite{2000MNRAS.314..858L}.

In our models, the binary fraction continues to drop well after
1\,Myr, and by the time the cluster is as old as Upper Scorpius ($\sim
11$\,Myr), very few \jumbos\, are left.  \cite{2022NatAs...6...89M},
reported the detection of 70 to 170 single jupiter-mass objects, none
of which is paired. Their observations are probably biased by missing
close pairs due to resolution issues with the older telescope.  But we
would not expact many \jumbos\, in Upper Scoprius anyway.  From our
simulations, we would expect a binary fraction of $\sim 2$\% among the
jupiter-mass objects. Upper Scoprius would then contain between 1 and
3\,\jumbos. So far, none are observed.

On the other hand, our calculations, did not include primordial
binaries (or higher order systems, not did we take the effect of
stellar evolution and supernovae into account. Those processes may
have a profound effect of the fraction of \jumbos, tending to reduce,
rather then increase their number.

\subsection{Failure of the ${\cal SPP}$ model}

The ${\cal SPP}$ model systematically fail to reproduce the observed
population of \jumbos\, by a factor of 50 to 400. Changing the initial
distribution in semi-major axis of the inner orbit from a uniform
distribution to a logarithmic distribution reduces the formation rate
of \jumbos\, even further.

To further explore the failure of model ${\cal SPP}$, we perform an
additional series of 26 simulations with pre-determined inner and
outer orbital separations $a_1$ and $a_2$ using the Plummer
distribution with virial radii of 0.25\,pc, and 0.50\,pc for the
stars.  According to \cite{2023arXiv231006016W}, the eventual orbital
separation of the \jumbo\, would be consistent with the difference in
orbital separation between the two planets when orbiting the star. For
this reason we perform an additional series of runs with a mutual
separation $a_2-a_1 = 100$\,au and $a_2-a_1 = 200$\,au, expecting
those to lead to consistent results in comparison with the
observations, as was argued in \cite{2023arXiv231006016W}.  The other
orbital parameters, for the planet masses, their eccentricites and
relative inclinations, in these models were identical to the other
${\cal SPP}$ models.  The results of these simulations are presented
in figure\,\ref{Fig:fjumbos_from_PP}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.91\columnwidth]{figures/fig_fjumbos_from_psystems.pdf}
        \caption{The number of jumbo's produced in model ${\cal SPP}$,
          as fraction of the number of free floating planets for
          various simulations starting with a Plummer sphere with a
          virial radius of 0.5\,pc.  The bullet points along each line
          correspond with the adopted orbital separation of the two
          planets ($a_1$ and $a_2$).  The red symbols indicate an
          average orbital separations for the jumbos between 25\,au
          and 380\,au.  The black symbols are outside this regime.
          The symbol sizes give the number of jumbos (see top right
          for scaling) in the particular simulation.  }
         \label{Fig:fjumbos_from_PP}
\end{figure}

For these models the \jumbo-formation efficiency peaks for an orbital
separation $a_1 \apgt 1000$\,au, but steeply drops for smaller values
of $a_1$. As proposd by \cite{2023arXiv231006016W}, we adopt a
difference in the initial orbital distance of about $a_2-a_1 =
100$\,au or 200\,au (see figure\,\ref{Fig:fjumbos_from_PP}), which
would lead to \jumbo\, orbits in the same range.  We performed a total
of 45 calculations with various ranges of $a_1$ and $a_2$, of which 39
produced a total of 910 \jumbos.  The eventual distribution in
separations is somewhat wider than claimed by
\cite{2023arXiv231006016W}, who argued that the initial orbital
distance $a_2-a_1$ would be preserved. We find a somewhat wider
distribution, but reasonably wise not inconsistent with the results of
\cite{2023arXiv231006016W}.

The rate, derived by \cite{2023arXiv231006016W}, however, appears to
be orders of magnitude smaller than they expected.  They calculate the
rate by means of 4-body scattering experiments, in which a star with
two equal-mass planets with semi-major axes $a_1$ for the inner and
$a_2$ for the other planet, encounters a single star. Their largest
cross section of roughly $a_1^2$ is obtained if the encounter velocity
$0.8v_\star/v_1$. For an encounter at the cluster's velocity
dispersion, the inner planet would then have a orbital separation of
$\sim 900$\,au around a 1\,\MSun\, star.

Around an 1\,\MSun\, star such a velocity is obtained,
assuming a Kepler orbit, at an orbital separation of 800\,au.


Note that an inner orbital separation of $a_1=900$\,au for a
10\,\MJup\, planet leads to a Hill radius of about 150\,au. An orbit
with $a_2=1100$\,au, is probably only marginally stable.  Still,
even in those runs the total number of \jumbos\, remains small
compared to the number of free floaters.

It turns
out, that the results of the cross section calculations performed by
\cite{2023arXiv231006016W} are consistent with our direct N-body
simulation, but that the adopted initial orbital separation is too
wide in comparison with a realistically population of inner planetary
orbits for jupiter-mass planets.  Observational selection effect in
finding $\apgt 800$\,au jupiter-mass planets are quite severe, but we
consider it unrealistic to have 300 out of 2500 stars to be orbited by
such wide planetary systems. In particular, when one considers the
small sizes of the observed disks in the Trapezium cluster, which
today are all smaller than 400\,au \cite{2005A&A...441..195V}.

\subsection{Free Floating Jupiter Mass Objects, model ${\cal FFC}$}

In scenario, $\mathcal{FFC}$, we initialize a number of single
Jupiter-mass objects in a cluster with no \jumbo\, systems (see
section\,\ref{Sect:FFC}).  The aim is to see the efficiency of forming
\jumbos\, via mutual captures of free floaters, or captures due to the
close stellar passage. The parameters of the cluster and free floaters
remain unchanged to those listed in section \ref{Sec:SF_Method}.

\subsection{Further constraining the initial conditions for model ${\cal ISF}$}

With the current models, we can further constrain the model parameters
by repeating several calculations for better statistics and exploring
other parts of the parameter space.  We perform this analysis for
model ${\cal ISF}$, because that model seems to be most viable for
producing a sufficiently large population of \jumbos, and they compare
well with the observed orbital characteristics.  Using the results of
the general models, we alter our initial conditions with the aim of
mimicking observations. Doing so allows us to disentangle aspects of
the cluster history, allowing for predictions on the properties of
\jumbo\, formation. These runs correspond to the middle segment of
table \ref{Tab:SF_FF_Params}.
    
For all models, we constrain $n_{\mathrm{\jumbo}} + n_{\mathrm{FF}}$
to values reflecting the total planetary-mass population observed in
\cite{2023arXiv231001231P}, keeping in mind the survival rate of
\jumbo systems based on previous results to decide on the initial
value of $N_{\mathrm{\jumbo}}$. The range of mass ratio and mass value
remains unchanged. The semi-major axis is uniformly distributed
between the restricted range $a\in[25,100]$ au.  Models Fr\_R050C and
Fr0FFOC look at scenarios where the initial \jumbo\, population has an
eccentricity ranging between $e\in[0,0.2]$ sampled from a uniform
distribution.

evolved during our $\mathcal{ISF}$ and $\mathcal{FFC}$ runs. The
density map reveals the final positions of all objects
simulated. Surviving \jumbos\, are scattered onto the plot with red
outlines. Overlayed are also the positions of known stars (in yellow)
taken from \cite{2016A&A...595A...1G, 2023A&A...674A...1G} and the
positions of known \jumbos\, (black outlined points)
\cite{2023arXiv231001231P}.

Table \ref{Tab:Final_ISF_FFC_Results} summarises all our final
results. We begin our discussion on the $\mathcal{ISF}$ models by
looking at the general models (top segment of table
\ref{Tab:ISF_FFC_Initial}).
     
The increase of \jumbo\, surviveability in runs including
free-floaters could be due to the rare interactions between JMOs and
\jumbos\, hardening the binary as a consequence, also resulting in a
decrease in its gravitational cross section.  Increasing the number of
JMOs enhances the chances of two free-floaters settling into a newly
formed binary, on average, only $0.4$ new \jumbo\, systems emerge per
run for F05 runs compared to the $0.65$ in F05FF (from $1.75$ to
$3.15$ between P05 and P05FF).
    
Figures \ref{Fig:Gen_Semi_Fractal} show the cumulative distribution
function for the semi-major axis of surviving \jumbos\, during
Fr\_050, Fr\_05off and Fr\_100 runs. The Fractal distribution
efficiently prunes off any wide orbits since its violent nature
provokes many encounters result in the ionisation of \jumbo\, systems,
moreso the ones on wide orbits have a larger cross-section. The
tendency for \jumbos\, to ionise at any encounter is reflected by the
little variation between runs of the same virial radius. We also note
the tendency for \jumbos\, to ionise even when a JMO perturbs the
system as reflected with the decrease in median semi-major axis
between models Pl\_050 and Pl\_050ff from $\langle a\rangle\sim268$ au
to $\langle a\rangle\sim187$ au.

      whereas dotted ones only those with a projected separation
      exceeding $25$ au.}
         \label{Fig:Gen_Semi_Fractal}
\end{figure}
    
In figure \ref{Fig:Gen_Semi_Plummer} we further illustrate how Plummer
models are capable of preserving the wider orbits.

        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/Plummer_General_sem_axis.pdf}

      with a projected separation exceeding $25$ au.}
         \label{Fig:Gen_Semi_Plummer}
\end{figure}

Indeed, keeping in mind that the \jumbos\, in these models are
generated from a uniform distribution, we see the uniformity
reflected in the final $M_{\mathrm{prim}}$ vs. $q$ parameter space
shown in figure \ref{Fig:Gen_mdistr_Plummer}. Although it also fails
at reproducing observations, figure \ref{Fig:Gen_mdistr_Fractal} shows
more structure and less uniformity in the distribution of \jumbos\, in
($M_{\mathrm{prim}}$, $q$)-space as reflected by the starker contrasts
between contour levels and smaller high-density regions.
    
We could continue calibrating the initial conditions for a more
consistent comparison with the observations, but the global parameter
tuning seems to indicate that either the Plummer models with a 0.5\,pc
virial radius or the fractal models with a $\sim 1$\,pc virial radius
give the best results.  At this point, we do not see a natural
mechanism to remove the tail of very wide-orbits among the \jumbos,
and it is a bit surprising that the observed orbital distribution
seems to cut off rather sharply at about 400\,au.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Evolving till $10$ Myr}

We analyse the results for mode ${\cal ISF\_Fr}$ to $10$ Myr.  Our aim
is to look at the survival of \jumbos\, in older systems systems, such
as Upper Scoprius. Overall, the \jumbo\, survival rate decreases
rapidly and the survivers have tighter orbits.  The population of
\jumbos\, eventually settles at a population of dynamically hard
paris, in which case the mean orbital separation $\langle a\rangle
\aplt 20$ for two $3\ M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ objects
        
Figure \ref{Fig:Mdistr_SimTime} shows the distribution of
$M_{\mathrm{prim}}$ of surviving \jumbos. The little difference
observed between F05FF and F05FFL is reflected by the similarities
between their median and interquartile range ($\langle
M_{\mathrm{prim}}\rangle\sim 8.8$ and $\langle
M_{\mathrm{prim}}\rangle \sim 8.1$ for models Fr\_050ff and Fr\_050ffL
respectively). This holds for all configurations simulated implies the
ease at which \jumbo\, systems ionise upon interaction.

Figure \ref{Fig:SimTime_MPrimQ} shows the contour plot of
$M_{\mathrm{prim}}$ vs. $q$. The parameter space poorly replicates the
observed distribution with most of the \jumbos\, having too large a
primary mass.

\end{figure}
   
\subsubsection{Observational Constraints}

When applying these more restricted initial conditions,
$f_{\mathrm{surv}}$ and $e$ barely changes while $a$ shows only
marginal changes.  This slight increase in
$f_{r_{ij}\geq25\ \mathrm{au}}$, $\langle a\rangle$ and $\langle
r_{ij}\rangle$ could be attributed to the reduction of JMO and
\jumbos\, present in the environment and the smaller masses they
occupy making it harder for them to ionize binaries. The difference in
the semi-major axis distribution between models Fr\_050, Fr\_050O and
F\_050OC (\jumbos\, are initially on circular orbits) is shown in
figure \ref{Fig:Semi_Fractal}. The Fractal models exhibit a natural
tendency for trimming out wide binaries.
    
\begin{figure}

        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/Fractal_noFF_sem_axis.pdf}
     \caption{CDF of surviving \jumbo\, semi-major axis distribution
       for models Fr\_050, F\_05oO, F\_050OC.}
         \label{Fig:Semi_Fractal}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{Fig:Fractal_mdistrCDF} shows the CDF of primary masses
comparing models F05, F05O And F05OC. No matter the configuration, a
similar evolution is observed where surviving \jumbos\, tend to have
larger primary masses. However, unlike the F05 model, the constrained
model, initialised with $\alpha = -1.25$, end up being roughly uniform
in primary mass compared to the somewhat thermal appearance for
F05. In doing, the median primary masses shift towards lower values
while the mass ratio towards larger one. A fact reflected by the
statistics shown in table \ref{Tab:Final_ISF_FFC_Results} and shown in
figure \ref{Fig:FractalObs_mdistr}.

         \label{Fig:Fractal_mdistrCDF}
   \end{figure}

The statistics of merging scenarios, and the emergence of both
Jupier-mass - Stellar binary systems and $N\geq3$ systems are
summarised in table \ref{Tab:Systems}.

In figure \ref{Fig:MixedSys_OrbParams}, we present the distribution of
the surviving \jumbos\, in semi-major axis and eccentricity. The stellar binaries occupy
roughly the same space.  The parameter space is widely covered, with
signs of low-eccentricity but very wide ($a\geq700$ au)
binaries. Nevertheless, the vast majority exhibit large eccentricities
and semi-major axis, reflecting their dynamical origin. The
non-negligible amount of these systems emerging provide an interesting
prospect of detecting ultra-cold Jupiters orbiting stars who have
recently fostered them.

    Given the poor reproducability in ratios of \jumbos\, to JMO free floaters and the tight orbits of \jumbos\, we conclude that the $\mathcal{ISF}$ models are most likely not the origins of \jumbos, lending us to our final possible scenario, $\mathcal{FFC}$.

    \subsection{$\mathcal{FFC}$}

Our slight preference for the fractal models stems from their natural
consequence of producing higher order hierarchical systems. Much in
the same was as the two triple \jumbos\, (Jupiter-mass Triple Objects,
JuMTO). In none of the Plummer models did we find triple formation,
and although rare, some of the fractal models produced one or two
triples. On the other hand, it seems evident that our understanding of
object formation at the low-mass end of the mass function for isolated
(or paired) objects is incomplete, we wonder how serious we should
take such allegations.

\section{Conclusions}

The discovery of relatively wide pairs of jupiter-mass planetary
objects in the Trapezium cluster emphasizes our limited understanding
of low-mass star and planet formation. In order to derive
characteristcs for their origin we performed simulations of
Trapezium-equivalent stellar clusters (2500 stars with a virialized
$\sim 0.5$\,pc radius) with various compositions of planetary objects
and stars.

Models in which planets form in wide circum-stellar orbits, as
proposed by \cite{2023arXiv231006016W}, produce many single free
floating planets, but an insufficient number of planet pairs per
cluster. The ratio of single to pairs of planets is too low by a
factor of 50 to 400.

The models in which pairs of planetary-mass objects orbit stars in the
form of a planet-moon system, produce many free floating planetary
pairs, and in the proper range of orbits.  In particular the models
that start with fractal initial conditions tend to produce a sufficent
fraction of jumbos of among free floating planets ${\cal O}(0.1)$,
which is close to the observed value of $0.078\pm0.012$.  These models
tend to predict rather low-eccentricities ($e\aplt 0.4$), whereas
others tend to lead to more thermalized distributions ($e\apgt 0.6$).

For model ${\cal SPM}$ to produce a sufficient number of \jumbos\, it
requires planet-moon pairs form in $\apgt 1000$\,au orbits around
their parent star. Such wide orbits are exotic considering the fact
that the circum-stellar disks observed in the Trapezium cluster tend
to be smaller than 400\,au. We therefore do not see how such wide
planet-moon pairs can form around stars.

Starting with a enormous population of ($10^3$ to $10^4$) isolated
free-floating planetary mass objects among the stars would grossly
underproduce the expected number of free floaters, and fail to
reproduce the observed number of \jumbos.  This model, however,
naturally leads to a mass-ratio distribution skewed to unity, as is
observed. We consider this model undesireable by the lack of a large
($\apgt 10^4$) population of free floating planets in the Trapezium
cluster. This could indicate the existence of a large population of
unobservable low-mass pbjects, but we consider this a rather exotic
possibility.

Ruling out models ${\cal SPP}$, ${\cal SPM}$ and ${\cal FFC}$, we are
left with the simplest and most satisfactory solution in which
\jumbos\, form together with the single stars in the cluster.  This
model does not only reproduce the observed rates, it can subsequently
also be used to further constrain the initial conditions of \jumbos.

In the Plummer models, only 10\% to 30\% of the \jumbos\, are ionized
within 1\,Myr.  The observed population of free floaters and \jumbos\,
can then be reproduced if the cluster was born with some 500 free
floating jupiter-mass planets and $\sim 50$\,\jumbos. The current
observed primary and secondary masses of \jumbos\, would then still
reflect the conditions at birth, but the semi-major axis and
eccentricity distributions would have been affected by encounters with
other cluster members. These processes tend to drive the eccentricity
distribution to resemble the thermal distribution (probably with an
excess of high ($\apgt 0.8$) eccentricities
\cite{2000IJoMP...15..4871P}. The semi-major axes of the jumbos would
have widened, on average by approximately 5\% due to encounters with
other cluster members (mainly free-floating planets).

Alternative to a Plummer initial stellar distribution we experimented
with fractal distributions, which also seem to be able to
satisfactorily reproduces the observed populations. In the fractal
models, $\sim 90$\,\% of the priordial \jumbos\, become ionized, and
in principle the entire observed populations of free-floating jupiter
mass objects and \jumbos\, can be explained by a 100\% initial
binarity among the \jumbos. We then conclude that single jupiter mass
objects are preferentially born in pars with a rather flat
distribution in orbital separations with a maximum of $\aplt 400$\,au.

This model satisfactorily explains the observed orbital separation
distribution, with a $\sim 15$\% excess of systems with a separation
$\apgt 400$\,au. We do expect a rich population of orbits with
separation smaller than the observed 25\,au, possibly down to sub-au
scales.  The masses of the primaries in the planet pairs, and the
mass-ratio distribution are then hardly affected by the past $\sim
1$\,Myr evolution of the Trapezium cluster.

We have a slight preference for the ${\cal ISF}$ fractal models with
0.5\,pc virial radius because hierarchical triple planets form
naturally in roughly the observed proportion (on average 4 triples
among $\sim 40$ pairs and $\sim 500$ single planets). The singles then
originate from broken up pairs, and the trples form in interactions
between two planet pairs. The dynamical formation of soft triple
planets is quite remarkable, and observational follow-up would be of
considerable interest.

The omission of Plummer models is further supported since no systems
formed dynamically during the runs. This contradicts with the observed
presence of two triple JMO systems. Given this, we restrict ourselves
to Fractal models as we believe this better represents the Trapezium
cluster, a fact agreeing with \cite{2016MNRAS.457..313P}.  The
short-periods and the small binary fraction of the fractal models
could be salvaged if the \jumbos\, form late. If the majority of the
observed population formed $\aplt 0.3$\,Myr ago, the cluster's density
profile would already have been smoothed out, leading to fewer strong
dynamical encounters. The cluster would somewhat resemble a \jumbo
-friendly Plummer-like structure. Not only would that mediate the
survival of \jumbos\, but it also would allow them to preservetheir
wide orbits, as observed.

Single free floating planetary objects were discovered in abundance
(between 70 and 170 candidates) before in the Upper Scorpius
association \cite{2022NatAs...6...89M}, but these were considered to
be single free floaters.  With an age of about 11\,Myr
\cite{2022NatAs...6...89M}, Upper Scoprius is expected to be rich in
single jupiter mass free floating planets, but binaries will be rare
as these have been broken.

Finally, we would like to comment briefly on the nature of the objects
observed. We wonder that, if these objects formed in situe, and
therefore not around a star, they would be deprived of a rocky core.
\jumbos\, and JMOs would then more reseble a star in terms of the
structure, rather than a planet. This may have interesting
consequences on their dynamics, evolution and the consequences of them
encountering another star. In these terms, we also wonder to what
degree the term ``planet'' is rectified at all, and maybe it is time
to revive the IAU discussion on the definition of a planet, and some
other recently discovered curious objects.

\section*{Software used for this study}

In this work we used the following packages: \texttt{python}
\cite{10.5555/1593511}, \texttt{SeBa} \cite{1996A&A...309..179P,
  2012A&A...546A..70T}, \texttt{AMUSE} \cite{2018araa.book.....P},

\section*{Energy Consumption}

The $820$ simulations conducted during this investigation had a total
wall-clock time of $432$ days. For the XYZ runs, each CPU used $6$
cores, for the other two configurations $18$ cores were used per
CPU. In total, the CPU time for all simulations was $7680$
days. Assuming a CPU consumption rate of $12$ Watt hr$^{-1}$
\cite{2020NatAs...4..819P}, the total energy consumption is roughly
$2210$ kWh. For an emission intensity of $0.283$ kWh kg$^{-1}$
\cite{doi:10.1002/cpe.3489}, our calculations emitted $7.8$ tonnes of
CO2, roughly equivalent to two round trips by plane New York -
Beijing.

  \section{Similarity between $r_{ij}$ and $a$}\label{Appendix:A}

  The comparison between simulations and observations is somewhat
  hindered by the different perspecitves. Whereas dynamicists prefer
  to use Kepler orbital elements, from an observational perspective
  such data is not always available. In our current study, we try to
  compare populations of binaries with observed objects. The latter
  are projected separattions, which do not directly translate in
  orbital elements without full knowledge of the 6-dimension phase
  space of the orbit. We thereofre have to compare projects separation
  with what we prefer to use, the semi-major axis of a bound two body
  orbit.

  Figures \ref{Fig:Plummer_rsep} and \ref{Fig:Fractal_rsep} motivate
  our choice of analysing results in terms of the semi-major axis
  given the similarity between the curves.
    
  In all cases, $r_{ij}$ exhibits longer tails at the detriment of the
  shorter separations/orbits. However, these differences are so small
  - especially in the Fractal case for which most of our discussion
  revolves around - that we can safely interchange between one and the
  other. In doing so, we assume that the observed projected separation
  of \jumbos\, are equivalent to their semi-major axis, easing our
  discussion.

We conclude that the observed \jumbos\, in the Trapezium cluster
formed as planetary pairs together with the other stars.
